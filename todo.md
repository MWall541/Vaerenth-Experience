New additions:

[ ] A dyeable variant of the Traveler's Robe from Iron's Spells n Spellbooks. Armor values per piece are, from helmet to boots: 2/6/5/2, with each piece adding +75 mana

[ ] Silver weapon set. These need to have iron-adjacent stats, but with the same anti-undead properties as the silver equipment from Ice and Fire. You can either make a new one or build off the existing one, I'm satisfied as long as the same green tooltip is used and it works with Consecration.

[ ] The black and gold lightning dragon variants (In-game: Voidstorm and Aurelian, respectively), plus their eggs.

[x] The three jousting trophies, with the rearing model only being used for the gold texture

[x] A void dimension with absolutely nothing in it; portal frame made from reinforced deepslate and ignited with a flint and steel but ONLY by a player in creative mode or /op, whichever's easiest. If you have a better way of going about this, like a custom uncraftable block or sometthing, I'm flexible. Also, Use the spruce trapdoor texture for the portal blocks so that it looks like doors.

[x] Another void dimension like the one above, but with a bedrock frame instead.

[x] The tips and mysticalchemy folders; to be added as they are. No further work on them is needed.

These features are in the 1.18 version, need them ported:

[x] The rusty weapons, which won't be actual weapons (Unless Blue wants to make handheld sprites) just items unobtainable in survival. The reason for this is because some undead enemies will drop them, then players can take them to a blacksmith to get a cultural version of the weapon. So like, a rusty spear can be traded to a grey elf blacksmith to get a grey elf spear. That kind of thing.

[x] Grey elf weapon set

[x] Disable the Fireward, Frostward, and Poisonward rings from Iron's Spells n Spellbooks from appearing in loot tables

[ ] The purple dragon skin for Zeslin which only Zyranna can unlock

[ ] A Broken state for all unique weapons instead of breaking. Currently, this only includes the Sword of Kings, but more will come.

[x] The Sword of Kings, but do three versions: One's a longsword, one's a greatsword, and one is a katana. Use the same sprite for each and make sure all three versions deal +1 damage against undead, like silver weapons do. Use a subtitle to differentiate:  
    [x] Longsword: You defeated the shade of King Arcturus and took this legendary sword from him. Wield it faithfully and it will serve you well.  
    [x] Greatsword:  You defeated the shade of King Arcturus and took this legendary sword from him. It's very heavy and lends itself well to spinning attacks.  
    [x] Katana: You defeated the shade of King Arcturus and took this legendary sword from him. The swordmasters of Tsukiyo have taught you their way of wielding a blade like this.  

[x] The Vaerenthian Shield (Give this like 20000 durability while you're at it)

[x] The coins for each region; also a copper glass needs a crafting recipe to turn one glass into two half-glasses, and vice versa.z
